Tippr
=====

A very simple, useful (to me) tipping app. Written in Swift.

All I've wanted from a tip calculator app is the ability to quickly calculate the 3 common tip 
amounts, with an optional round up button for when your bill is close to the nearest dollar.

And then it should be dark themed, because how embarrasing is it when you're at a dark bar/restaurant and 
your phone becomes a lighthouse beacon to everyone around.


TO DO
=====
- add an app icon
- actually put this in the app store
- add a setting page, with options for tip amounts
- perhaps allow tipping calculator for before tax amount?
